# TaskFlow
TaskFlow is a lightweight, high-performance task management application built with Pure JavaScript (Vanilla JS).
Key Features
Drag-and-Drop Interface: Effortlessly move tasks between 'To-Do', 'In-Progress', and 'Done' columns.

Persistent Storage: Uses localStorage to ensure your tasks are saved even after closing the browser or refreshing the page.

Real-time UI Updates: Experience smooth, flicker-free interactions without page reloads.

Responsive Design: Fully optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Modular Architecture: Built with clean, scalable code following modern JavaScript best practices.

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid, Animations)

Scripting: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Storage: Browser LocalStorage API.

The Challenges I Solved
State Management: Implementing a system to sync the UI with the data stored in localStorage without using a library like Redux.

Drag-and-Drop Logic: Writing custom event handlers for dragstart, dragover, and drop to ensure a smooth user experience across different browsers.

DOM Optimization: Efficiently updating the DOM to handle multiple task additions and deletions without affecting performance.
